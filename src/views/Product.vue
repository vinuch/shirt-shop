        A dashiki is a colorful garment that covers the top 
        half of the body. The dashiki found a market in America during 
        the Black cultural and political struggles in the 1960s. The dashiki 
        rebelled against menâ€™s fashions of that time: brightly colored instead of drab,
        loose instead of tight, worn outside the pants instead of tucked in.
        It could be worn defiantly on occasions that normally would call for a coat and tie.
